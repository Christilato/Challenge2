           <p>
            An enthusiastic energy that never backs down from a challenge. Graduated from
            Indiana University in 2019 with a BS in Apparel Merchandising & a minor in Business. 
            Post graduation, she worked for Lana Jewelry in Customer Service & then Logistics. Unfortunately, the pandemic ended my time there. 
            After months of figuring out this new world, I founded RH. There I was a support associate to the overall gallery. 

            My time at all the companies I have worked for has been amazing and I am thankful for the 
            opportunities I had. These opportunities are what led me here right now. To want to grow and expand 
            my knowledge even more, by coding! In today's time it is becoming a necessity. I am excited to learn!
